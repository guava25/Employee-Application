            <h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR APPLICANTS REGARDING</h2>
            <h1>FINGERPRINTING BACKGROUND CHECKS</h1>
            <p>On January 27, 1997, Senate Bill # 160 became effective. This bill (section 3701.881) requires that fingerprinting background checks be performed on all potential applicants. There are two different kinds of background check. An Ohio background check may be performed if an individual can prove that he/she has been a resident of Ohio for 5 years. If a potential applicant can not submit substantial proof for 5 year Ohio residency, then an FBI background check along with an Ohio background check is required.</p>
            <p>Prices for these background checks are listed below for your reference. The cost for the fingerprinting background check(s) are the applicantâ€™s responsibility.</p>
            <p>The applicant may be employed conditionally while the background check is being obtained. In accordance with the Act, employment will be terminated if: (1) the background check is not received withxin sixty (60) days of the request, or (2) the results of the background check indicate that the individual has been convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, one of the listed offenses (attached) or any existing or former law of the state, any other state, or the United States, that is substantially equivalent to one of those offenses.</p>
