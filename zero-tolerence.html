                    <p>Our policy is “Zero Tolerance” in regard to abuse in the workplace, either from a client or an employee. Abuse is defined as any action which results in feeling threatened, coerced, intimidated, harassed, or humiliated. This may include but not limited to:</p>

            <p>In order to provide a safe environment for our clients and staff, the following guidelines will be used in the event someone feels threatened.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The visit will be terminated immediately if you are asked to leave or you feel threatened and leave. It is our belief that separation of the parties involved will act to diffuse any potential problem situation. If necessary and appropriate, the supervisor will get another staff member to complete the visit. Each party is responsible for reporting the incident to the office.</li>
                <li>An investigation of the incident will be initiated and all parties will be informed of the result of the investigation. Clients and staff will be treated with dignity and respect at all times and under any circumstance abuse of any nature will not be tolerated. Any employee found guilty of abusing a patient is subject to <b><u>immediate</u></b> termination.</li>
